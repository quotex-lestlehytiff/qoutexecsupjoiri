In this article, we will explore the issue of Quotex halal or haram and
provide you with all the information you need to make an informed
decision about whether or not to trade with this broker.

## What is Halal?

Halal is an Arabic term that means "permissible" or
"lawful". In the context of Islam, halal refers to things that are
permitted under Islamic law. This includes food, drinks, clothing, and
activities. Gambling and usury are not halal, so investing in a platform
that allows gambling or usury would not be considered halal.

## Is Quotex Halal?

So, is Quotex halal? The answer to this question is not entirely
straightforward. There are some aspects of Quotex that are halal and
some that are not.

that the trading platform itself is halal. However, it is important to
note that the underlying assets that are traded on Quotex may not be
halal.

For example, if you are trading forex, you are essentially betting on
the value of one currency against another. This is not considered
gambling, but it is not halal either. This is because the underlying
asset (currency) is not halal.

Similarly, if you are trading stocks, you are essentially betting on the
value of a company. This is not gambling, but it is not halal either.
This is because the underlying asset (stock) is not halal.
